"""
This script performs image classification using a pre-trained neural network model.
It loads an image from disk, preprocesses it, passes it through the model, and displays the predicted class label and probability on top of the image.

The script uses the OpenCV library and requires the following files:
- classification_classes_ILSVRC2012.txt: A text file containing the ImageNet class names.
- DenseNet_121.caffemodel: The pre-trained DenseNet-121 model weights.
- DenseNet_121.prototxt: The model configuration file.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Reads the ImageNet class names from the classification_classes_ILSVRC2012.txt file.
2. Loads the DenseNet-121 model using cv2.dnn.readNet() function.
3. Loads the image from disk using cv2.imread() function.
4. Creates a blob from the image using cv2.dnn.blobFromImage() function.
5. Sets the input blob for the neural network using model.setInput() function.
6. Performs a forward pass of the image blob through the model using model.forward() function.
7. Processes the output to get the predicted class label and probability.
8. Displays the predicted class label and probability on top of the image using cv2.putText() function.
9. Shows the image with the predicted class label and probability using cv2.imshow() function.
10. Saves the image with the predicted class label and probability to the outputs/result_image.jpg file using cv2.imwrite() function.
